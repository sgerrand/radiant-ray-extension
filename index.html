  <span class="description">friendly extension management for radiant cms using git or http.</span>

  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Ray is just a rake file with some tasks that simplify the installation, disabling, enabling, uninstallation and searching
    of Radiant extensions. Although Ray relies on GitHub (as the extension host) it does not rely on the <code>git</code>
    command line tools; if you don&#8217;t have <code>git</code> installed then the Ruby Open-URI library is used to download
    compressed archives.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, you need at least <code>git</code> or <code>tar</code> installed in addition to the normal Radiant stack;
    Windows users probably need one of those &#8220;unixy&#8221; environment things since Ray does occasionally call out to
    system tools (I really don&#8217;t know about Windows though). Ray <strong>only</strong> supports <code>git</code>;
    although I&#8217;d gladly accept a patch that used <code>git</code>&#8217;s tools to access CVS, SVN or whatever else it can handle.
    If you need to install extensions from other sources, such as Subversion, you should use Radiant&#8217;s built-in
    <code>script/extension install</code> command which can handle a wide variety of installation types.

  <h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
  <p>If you have Radiant 0.6.8 or newer simply run</p>
<pre><code>script/extension install ray</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you&#8217;re on an older version of Radiant and have <code>git</code> installed, move to your Radiant site&#8217;s
    <code>vendor/extension</code> directory and run
  </p>
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension.git ray</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you prefer to manage your extensions as <code>git</code> submodules, move to your Radiant site&#8217;s
    <code>vendor/extension</code> directory and run
  </p>
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension.git ray</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you don&#8217;t have <code>git</code> installed download the
    <a href="http://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension/tarball/master">tar</a> or
    <a href="http://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension/zipball/master">zip</a>
    archive from GitHub, unpack it and place it in <code>vendor/extensions/ray</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ray does not have any installation tasks to run, in fact you don&#8217;t even need to restart Radiant in order to start
    using the tasks.
  </p>
  <h2 id="upgrading-with-git">Upgrading with Git</h2>
<pre><code>cd vendor/extensions/ray
git pull origin master</code></pre>
  <h2 id="upgrading-with-http">Upgrading with HTTP</h2>
  <p>
    Delete your existing version, then download the
    <a href="http://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension/tarball/master">tar</a> or
    <a href="http://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension/zipball/master">zip</a>
    archive from GitHub, unpack it and place it in <code>vendor/extensions/ray</code>.
  </p>

  <h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
  <p>
    Note: <strong>You can run <code>rake ray:help:shortcuts</code> for a list of shorter versions of the most common
    commands.</strong>
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-install">Installing extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Most of what you&#8217;re likely to be doing with Ray is installing extensions, so Ray tries to make this as easy as
    possible. You don&#8217;t even need to know the name or author of the extension you want to install.
  </p>
  <p>Take a look at the output from this command and you&#8217;ll see what I mean.</p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:install name=meta

==============================================================================
I couldn't find an extension named 'meta'.
The following is a list of extensions that might be related.
Use the command listed to install the appropriate extension.
==============================================================================
  extension: metaweblog
     author: skrat
description: Radiant extension to allow publishing/adding pages via MetaWeb...
    command: rake ray:extension:install name=metaweblog
==============================================================================
  extension: seo_help
     author: saturnflyer
description: Provides extra tags for page meta information.
    command: rake ray:extension:install name=seo_help
==============================================================================</code></pre>

  <p>
    What happened was Ray searched for an extension named &#8220;meta&#8221;, didn&#8217;t find one, then searched through all
    the available extensions for the ones that include &#8220;meta&#8221; in their name or description. Notice on the last line
    of each extension listing is the Ray command you&#8217;d run to install that extension. Don&#8217;t worry, if you know the
    name of the extension you want it will be installed &#8220;no questions asked.&#8221;
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-search">Searching for extensions</h2>
  <p>
    While not installing extensions you&#8217;ll probably spend a fair amount of time looking for extensions that fulfill your
    various desires. Of course, you can just jump on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, search around and then come back
    to the terminal to install your finds; but why bother ever leaving the terminal?
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:search term=blog
  
==============================================================================
  extension: metaweblog
     author: skrat

    command: rake ray:extension:install name=metaweblog

    command: rake ray:extension:install name=import-mephisto

    command: rake ray:extension:install name=blogtags
==============================================================================</code></pre>

  <p>
    Again the Ray command you&#8217;d run to install an extension is listed on the last line of each extension listing. I
    imagine you&#8217;re now asking, &#8220;But how do I spend a rainy day exploring the 150+ extensions for
    Radiant?&#8221;
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:all</code></pre>
  <p>Additionally, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:home name=blog</code></pre>
  <p>
    to quickly open your default browser to the Github page for any extension. Which is handy when the truncated descriptions
    from the search aren&#8217;t completely useful, you want more information or need help with an extension.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-disable">Disabling extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Regardless whether or not you used Ray to install an extension, Ray can disable it for you. Disabling an extension is a
    safe operation in that no data is destroyed, it&#8217;s just moved to a location where Radiant doesn&#8217;t look for
    extensions.
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:disable name=extension_name</code></pre>
  <h2 id="ext-enable">Enabling extensions</h2>
  <p>
    After you&#8217;ve disabled an extension with Ray you can enable it again just as easily. Enabling an extension is only
    possible if you disabled it with Ray; it <strong>is not</strong> for installing new extensions.
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:enable name=extension_name</code></pre>
  <h2 id="ext-uninstall">Uninstalling extensions</h2>
  <p>
    As with disabling it doesn&#8217;t matter whether or not you used Ray to install an extension, Ray can uninstall it for
    you. Uninstalling an extension destroys as much data associated with the extension as possible, and is therefore not
    recommend in all but the most extreme cases when <strong>you are sure you&#8217;re really done</strong> with an
    extension.
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:uninstall name=extension_name</code></pre>
  <p>
    Due to the nature of extensions it&#8217;s not possible to guarantee all the static assets (javascripts, stylesheets,
    images, etc.) will be deleted. Since these files reside in various locations throughout your <code>site/public</code>
    directory Ray chooses to take a conservative approach when tracking files down for deletion. Therefore, if you&#8217;re
    really dedicated to getting rid of all traces of an extension you&#8217;ll still need to poke around in
    <code>site/public</code> to manually verify the uninstallation of static assets.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-update">Updating extensions</h2>
  <p>Ray makes updating your installed extensions simple.</p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:update           # update Ray
rake ray:extension:update name=xyz  # update the xyz extension
rake ray:extension:update name=all  # update all extensions (except Ray)</code></pre>
  <p>
    Currently Ray itself can only be updated with Git but I&#8217;d like to change this in the near future. All other
    extensions can be updated with Git or <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-bundle">Bundling extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Bundling extensions is handy for site maintainers who want to spend a little less time re-installing a site&#8217;s
    extensions every time they load it up on a new system. The idea is provide a single file that describes the extensions and
    extension dependencies that Ray can then examine and act upon.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this feature you&#8217;ll need to create a file called <code>extensions.yml</code> inside your
    <code>site/config</code> directory. Here&#8217;s an example <code>extensions.yml</code> file.
  </p>
<pre><code>---
- name: aggregation
- name: link-roll
- name: help
- name: markdown
- name: page_attachments
  lib: mini_magick
- name: blog
  hub: netzpirat
  remote:
    - saturnflyer</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you have an existing <code>extensions.yml</code> file you use with Ray 1.x you&#8217;ll need to update it before
    it&#8217;s compatibile with Ray 2.x; mostly this will just require deleting things that Ray can now determine on its
    own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you&#8217;ve created your <code>extensions.yml</code> file you can install those extensions by running the
    command:
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:bundle</code></pre>
  <p>
    Please refer to the <a href="#legacy-information">Legacy Information</a> page for details on upgrading a Ray 1.x
    <code>extensions.yml</code> bundle file.
  </p>

  <h1 id="extension-dependencies">Extension dependencies</h1>
  <p>
    Note: <strong>If your extension dependencies have their own dependencies it&#8217;s best if each extension only includes
    it&#8217;s immediate dependents and let the dependencies cascade until they have all been satisfied; i.e. if your extension
    requires X which requires Y which requires Z only declare your dependence on X and have Y declare it&#8217;s dependence on
    Z and so on.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    While extension bundling is for site maintainers, extension dependencies are for extension authors. As you can probably
    guess it lets you tell Ray about your extension&#8217;s dependencies. All you need is a <code>dependency.yml</code> file in
    the root directory of your extension. Here&#8217;s an example dependency file:
  </p>
<pre><code>- extension: my_extension_helpers</code></pre>
  <p>
    You can list as many dependencies as you need and they can include gems as well as other extensions. In the case of
    extensions you may also use the <code>hub</code> option if you depend on a forked version of a repository.
  </p>
<pre><code>- extension: this_extension_helps_a_ton
  hub: extension_forker
- extension: some_other_voodoo
- gem: this_one
- gem: that_too</code></pre>
  <p>
    The absence of support for plugin dependencies is intentional. You are much better off adding plugins to your extension as
    <code>git</code> submodules and letting Ray deal with them during the normal installation of your extension. As an added
    bonus your plugin dependencies will also be recognized and respected by Radiant&#8217;s built-in <code>script/extension
    install</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: <strong><code>dependencies.yml</code> is an acceptable file name and <code>.yaml</code> is an acceptable
    file extension</strong>.
  </p>

  <h1 id="advanced-usage">Advanced usage</h1>
  <h2 id="setup-download">Download preference setup</h2>
  <p>
    The most important of Ray&#8217;s setup tasks, <code>rake ray:setup:download</code>, will be run for you automatically the
    first time you try to install an extension. However you might not have had <code>git</code> installed when you initially
    installed Ray. If that&#8217;s the case you can change your preference by running:
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:setup:download</code></pre>
  <h2 id="setup-restart">Server restart preference setup</h2>
  <p>
    Ray&#8217;s other setup task, <code>rake ray:setup:restart</code>, can be used to have Ray automatically restart your
    server whenever necessary, such as after you install a new extension. Currently, Ray supports restarting a single Mongrel,
    a Mongrel cluster, Phusion Passenger, Thin or Unicorn; note: single Mongrels, Thin and Unicorn need to be running in daemon
    mode.
  </p>
<pre><code>rake ray:setup:restart server=mongrel_cluster
rake ray:setup:restart server=mongrel
rake ray:setup:restart server=passenger
rake ray:setup:restart server=thin
rake ray:setup:restart server=unicorn</code></pre>
  <h2 id="ext-remote">Adding extension remotes</h2>
  <p>
    Before you get going with remote branches in Ray you&#8217;ll need to make sure you&#8217;ve setup at least your GitHub
    username in your global <code>git</code> configuration file.
  </p>
<pre><code>git config --global github.user your_github_username</code></pre>
  <p>
    That will add a bit of code to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. Ray can then use that information to determine when
    you&#8217;re installing your own extensions. Now when you install from your own repositories Ray will use your private
    URL instead of the public one; which means you can push your local changes back to your GitHub repository.
  </p>
  <p>Now you can install your extensions as you normally would with Ray. Then tell Ray which other users you want to track.</p>
<pre><code>rake ray:extension:install name=extension
rake ray:extension:remote name=extension hub=other_user</code></pre>
  <p>
    As you add remotes Ray will setup tracking branches named like &#8220;other_user/branch_name&#8221; for each branch the
    remote user has in their repository. Nothing is merged by Ray and you&#8217;ll be returned to your current branch after the
    remote is setup. Just like when you&#8217;re using <code>git</code> directly you&#8217;ll want to <strong>make sure your
    current branch is clean</strong> (commit or stash) before adding remotes; and afterward use your normal <code>git</code>
    workflow to inspect and merge changes.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-pull">Pulling extension remotes</h2>
  <p>
    Once you&#8217;ve setup a remote repository on an extension you&#8217;ll want to pull down the changes occasionally. You
    can pull in the remote repositories for either a specific extension or all extensions with remotes setup.
  </p>
<pre><code># pull remotes on a single extension
rake ray:extension:pull name=extension_name

# pull remotes on all extensions
rake ray:extension:pull</code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Ray does not merge anything into your master branch</strong>, after pulling in changes use your normal
    <code>git</code> workflow to inspect and merge these changes.
  </p>

  <h1 id="legacy-information">Legacy information</h1>
  <p>
    For the most part each Ray release is &#8220;compatible&#8221; with the previous one. Occasionally though things change
    between versions, you can find out all about what &#8220;breaking&#8221; changes the latest version has here.
  </p>
  <h2 id="shortcuts-redux">&#8220;Where&#8217;d my shortcut go?&#8221;</h2>
  <p>
    In some cases, a shortcut that existed in Ray 1.x will no longer be present in Ray 2.&#215;. Although the command is still
    there in long form you may find this to be a particular hassle, in that case please
    <a href="http://github.com/johnmuhl/radiant-ray-extension/issues">create a ticket</a> complaining about it and I&#8217;ll
    give you your shortcut back.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ext-bundle-diff">&#8220;What changed in <code>extensions.yml</code>?&#8221;</h2>
  <p>
    All users of the extension bundling mechanism will need to update their <code>extensions.yml</code> before Ray 2.x can
    understand them. This is mainly because the original format was not very well considered; you&#8217;ll find most of your
    updating gets done with the delete key.
  </p>
  <p>For example, the old demonstration <code>extensions.yml</code> which looked like:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: aggregation
- name: link-roll
- name: help
  hub: saturnflyer
- name: markdown
  hub: johnmuhl
  lib: rdiscount
  vendor: markdown_filter
- name: page_attachments
  plugin: attachment_fu
  plugin_repository: technoweenie
  lib: mini_magick
- name: blog
  hub: netzpirat
  remote: saturnflyer/radiant-blog-extension</code></pre>
  <p>In Ray 2, the same <code>extensions.yml</code> looks basically the same; just with more less:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: aggregation
- name: link-roll
- name: help
- name: markdown
- name: page-attachments
  lib: mini_magick
- name: blog
  hub: netzpirat
  remote:
    - saturnflyer</code></pre>
  <p>
    You don&#8217;t need to list the <code>lib</code> on the RDiscount Markdown filter because it
    <a href="#extension-dependencies">declares it&#8217;s own dependencies</a>. For an extension that requires a gem but
    doesn&#8217;t declare it&#8217;s dependencies you&#8217;ll still need to use the <code>lib</code> option.
  </p>
  <h2 id="shortcuts">&#8220;What if I like typing?&#8221;</h2>
  <p>
    Users of previous versions may notice that the commands have changed. While this appears to be the case it&#8217;s not
    actually (mostly). All the same old commands are available, so if you got comfortable with
    <code>rake ray:extension:install name=mailer</code> and don&#8217;t want to switch to <code>rake ray:i name=mailer</code>
    you can keep right on using the long versions. You can get a reminder of the shortcuts with the
    <code>rake ray:help:shortcuts</code> command.
