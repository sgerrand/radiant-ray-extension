By truly static, I mean that an HTML, CSS, JS, or whatever type of content you have stored as a Page is rendered and then subsequently stored in a temporary directory. After generating the rendered pages, Electrostatic will copy in the contents of your public directory. In theory, doing this will create a stand-alone directory of your static content.
